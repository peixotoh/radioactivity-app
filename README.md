# Radioactive Cloud Dispersion Visualizer

An interactive web application to visualize radioactive cloud dispersion from **1,096 meteorological simulations** of hypothetical nuclear accidents at **three nuclear power plants** in Europe.

> 🔗 **[Launch the App](https://radioactivity-app.streamlit.app)

This app is based on a scientific study co-authored by the developer and uses **freely available data** from the [Institut Biosphère / Genève](https://nrisk.institutbiosphere.ch/).

## 🌍 Overview

The application provides:
- A dynamic **map** showing the radioactive cloud dispersion.
- A **bar chart** and **data table** presenting the number of people potentially affected.
- **Date and plant selection** options to explore different simulation scenarios.
- Automatic retrieval of the corresponding data from the Biosphere Institute's website.

> ⚠️ The population impact values shown in this app are based solely on the **Europe** dataset (covering 31 or 51 countries depending on the nuclear power plant) from the Institut Biosphère (https://nrisk.institutbiosphere.ch/in-en.html). Although detailed data by individual countries or groups is available, this app uses the continental view for simplicity.

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Select simulation **date**
- 🏭 Choose **nuclear plant**
- 🗺️ Visualize **dispersion patterns** on an interactive map
- 📥 **Download** the map in KML format
- 📊 View an interactive **bar chart** (built with Plotly) showing population affected by mSv level
- 📥 Inspect and **download** the raw data table with exposure values
